            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In this learning outcome, I explored front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I integrated version control tools to enhance my workflow. My journey began with understanding the fundamentals of structuring, styling, and scripting web pages and evolved into effectively managing project versions using Git and GitHub. These tools allowed me to document changes, collaborate with my team, and maintain a clean development process.

            <h2>Git and GitHub</h2>
            <p>
                After my first portfolio review, I realized the importance of proper version control. I started using Git for managing versions of my projects and GitHub as a platform for hosting my repositories. While my initial GitHub structure was disorganized, I have since restructured it to ensure that folders and files are clearly organized and easy to navigate. This helped me keep track of different iterations of my projects and collaborate effectively with teammates.

            <h2>Notion for Documentation</h2>
            <p>
                I used Notion to document and organize evidence for my portfolio. This included storing screenshots, progress updates, and additional resources. Notion has been invaluable in keeping my work well-structured and easily accessible.

            <h2>Monk Development Project</h2>
            <p>
                As part of the Monk development project, I collaborated with my team to create a web page that met the project requirements. GitLab was our primary tool for version control, enabling seamless collaboration and ensuring that all team members could work efficiently on the project.

            <h2>Portfolio and project X Development</h2>
            <p>
                The development of my portfolio and project X went through several iterations. The initial versions lacked a cohesive layout and structure. After receiving feedback, I redesigned the pages to make them more user-friendly and visually appealing. Below I made a PDF file showing the progression of my portfolio:

            <h2>Challenges and Improvements</h2>
            <p>
                One of the challenges I faced was adjusting image sizes on my web pages. Some images were too large, affecting the layout. To address this, I consulted my teacher and after that I decided to put all of my screenshots into seperate PDF files for better organisation. This experience taught me the importance of testing and refining design elements.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                This semester, I enhanced my understanding of front-end development and version control. Using Git and GitHub improved my ability to manage project iterations and collaborate with others. Working on the Monk development project and my portfolio taught me the value of proper documentation and consistent coding practices. Moving forward, I aim to further improve my repository structure and refine my design skills to meet professional standards.

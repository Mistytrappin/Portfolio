            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In this semester, I focused on expanding my skills in both web design and digital content creation, while also developing my social media presence. Through various projects, including creating prototypes, designing album covers, and producing visualizers for my music, I learned how to apply design principles in a more practical and personal context. Additionally, I gained experience in organizing and presenting my work, using tools like Figma, CapCut, Canva, and AI to create content. Throughout this process, I also managed to grow my social media following, significantly increasing my TikTok views and YouTube subscribers. This semester has been instrumental in enhancing both my designing and creative skills, allowing me to effectively combine design and digital marketing strategies.

            <h2>Project PDFs</h2>
            <p>
                Each project I worked on is documented in a dedicated PDF file that includes detailed evidence, progress, and prototypes. These PDFs are listed below:

            <h2>Challenges and Improvements</h2>
            <p>
                One major challenge was optimizing images on my page. Large, unscaled images caused layout issues and slowed down loading times. However, I quickly realized that organizing my projects as PDFs would allow for a more structured and accessible way to present my designs. This change required adapting my workflow to ensure that the information was presented clearly and professionally. Another challenge was the iterative process of creating prototypes, as it required careful attention to detail and constant refinement to ensure that the designs met both usability and visual appeal standards..

            <p> Through the entire semester, I also consistently developed my designing and editing skills with my music journey. I gained new knowledge in programs like Capcut, Canvas and figma. I also developed social media presence linked to my YouTube channel. I now have 63k followers on TikTok and 16k subscribers on YouTube. On TikTok, I’ve been gathering a large number of views. Since September, I’ve generated around 800,000 views in total on Tiktok alone.</p>

            <h2>Reflection:</h2>
            <p>Throughout this semester, I significantly improved my ability to create effective prototypes and design interactive elements. I learned how crucial it is to focus on structure and usability when creating wireframes and layouts. The experience also reinforced my understanding of the importance of presenting designs in an organized manner, which was achieved by shifting to PDF files for better clarity and professionalism.
                Beyond my school projects, this semester I also worked on designing the cover for my music album and creating thumbnails for my YouTube songs. These personal projects allowed me to apply the same design principles in a different context, expanding my skill set in visual content creation across multiple platforms. Reflecting on both academic and personal projects, I feel more confident in my ability to approach design tasks with a user-centered mindset, creating visually appealing and functional designs. In the future semester I plan to continue developing my designing skills, for example learning how to use Adobe photoshop.</p>

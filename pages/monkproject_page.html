            <p>In both phases of the Monk project, I worked as a designer and programmer. My focus was on creating prototypes, creating content strategy, improving the website's visibility, and designing a filter option.

                Throughout the project, I collected and applied feedback from my group members and teachers. I tested different layout ideas to make the website modern looking and visually appealing. My main goal was to ensure the that prototypes and my page looked professional and met the project requirements.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This learning outcome focuses on applying research and stakeholder communication to web design principles. By engaging with instructors via email, I gained valuable insights that shaped my approach to creating an accessible and visually appealing website. The grid layout structure and interactive elements reflect this collaborative and research-driven methodology.

        <p><strong>Reflection:</strong>I created a project plan for my portfolio and for the project X to make the processes of making the projects more organized and efficient. By breaking down the tasks into smaller steps and assigning deadlines to each, I could stay on track and make sure everything gets done on time. These plans helped me to stay focused on one thing at a time, from research and design to coding and adding content. It also allows me to incorporate feedback at the right moments and make adjustments as I go. With everything laid out in the plan, I can easily track my progress and avoid feeling overwhelmed, making the whole process smoother and more manageable.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Over the course of this semester, I developed a deep understanding of research and stakeholder communication. User testing and iterative processes enriched my ability to create user-friendly, visually appealing designs. Researching about technologies such as JavaScript animations expanded my technical toolkit. Additionally, the research conducted during the Monk Project introduced me to target groups like climbers, enhancing my perspective on diverse user needs and behaviors. These experiences have significantly broadened my design capabilities and professional approach.

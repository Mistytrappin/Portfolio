            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In this learning outcome I focused on applying web design principles, particularly layout structure and interactive elements. Using a grid layout, I structured content to create a clean, organized, and accessible websites. This ensured usability and visual appeal. 
                I also integrated a contact form to demonstrate my skills in adding interactive features, showcasing my ability to create dynamic and user-friendly components.

            <h2>Responsiveness</h2>
            <p>Ensuring responsiveness was a key focus, using grid and java script to adapt content seamlessly across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile). This aligns with modern web development standards.</p>
            <p>I Created clickable elements using Java script with hovering effect for my project X page.</p>

            <h2>User Testing and Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                User testing was conducted with four individuals, gathering feedback to refine usability. I compiled the results into a PDF report, which highlighted the main areas for improvement. This was valuable because it allowed me to make data-driven decisions and refine the website based on real user feedback, improving its overall quality. A testing video and report are linked below:

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                In conclusion, this learning outcome allowed me to effectively apply key web design principles, particularly in terms of layout structure and interactive elements. By focusing on a user-centered design approach, I created a clear and intuitive website, with interactive features such as buttons with hover animations, enhancing user engagement. The iterative design process and user testing helped refine the project, ensuring a more polished and functional final product. In the future, I plan to further develop my skills in creating advanced interactive components, such as more complex CSS animations and JavaScript-driven features, while continuing to improve my testing processes for even more user-centered designs</p>

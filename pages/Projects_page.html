            <p>In the BLIK project, I took on the role of a designer, focusing on creating prototypes and improving the overall look of the website. I also participated in presentations with stakeholders and prepared slides to showcase the design process, including fonts and prototypes I worked on.

                Throughout the project, I made sure to gather and apply feedback, testing different color schemes and layouts to create a user-friendly and visually appealing design. My goal was to ensure the website looked professional and met the needs of the project.</p>

            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>

                In the BLIK project, I gained valuable experience in designing website prototypes and incorporating feedback throughout the process. By experimenting with different color schemes and layouts, I was able to refine the design to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly. Presenting my work to stakeholders and working with their feedback helped me improve my skills in adapting designs to meet user needs and expectations. Additionally, I learned the importance of consistency in design and how to balance creativity with functionality to create a professional final product.
                
                This project taught me how to handle design challenges effectively, refine prototypes based on feedback, and present my ideas clearly. It also helped me improve my skills in using design tools like Figma and collaborating with others to ensure the design aligns with the projectâ€™s goals.</p>

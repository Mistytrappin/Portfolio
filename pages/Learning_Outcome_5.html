            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>This semester has been a time of self-reflection and growth. Taking a personality test during class gave me valuable insights into my strengths and weaknesses in group projects, helping me better understand my role and how I can improve my collaboration skills.</p>
                
                

        <p><strong>Personal growth:</strong>I took a personality test during one of our lectures, to determine my typical role in group projects and to identify my strengths and weaknesses. 16Personalities Free personality test | 16Personalities</p>
            

        <p><strong>Independence:</strong>I value the ability to make my own decisions and control my future. Whether it's in my personal life or career, being able to take charge of my path and not rely on others is really important to me. I believe independence helps me grow as an individual and also pushes me to be more self-reliant.

        <br><strong> Ambition: </strong> I’m driven to push myself and work towards bigger goals. I’m always thinking about how to improve, whether it's with my projects in the iniversity, my music, or my career. I want to be successful not just for the sake of it, but because I believe in challenging myself and becoming the best version of who I can be.
    
        <br><strong>Integrity: </strong> For me, it’s essential to always stay true to myself and be honest in everything I do. I believe integrity builds trust, and trust is something that I value deeply in all relationships, whether personal or professional. Staying aligned with my values, even when it’s difficult, is important for my sense of self.
    
        <br><strong>Creativity: </strong> is something I really value, especially in the work I do. Whether I’m working on a new music track or a personal project, being able to think outside the box and express myself freely is what drives me. It allows me to feel fulfilled and connected to what I’m passionate about.</p>


        <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> core values is an essential part of shaping both personal and professional growth. These values guide my decisions, help me stay focused on my goals, and keep me aligned with what truly matters to me in life.</p>
            <br>

                <p><strong>Codeacademy:</strong></p>
                <p>I have completed several courses on Codecademy and continue to take new ones to develop my skills. Engaging in these courses is important because it allows me to learn practical programming techniques and stay updated with the latest trends in technology. Consistent learning helps me build confidence in my abilities and prepares me for real-world challenges in coding. By continuously improving, I can adapt to new tools and frameworks, which is essential for personal and professional growth in a rapidly evolving field.</p>

            <p> Throughout the semester, I consistently worked on developing my designing and editing skills, especially through my music journey. I gained new knowledge in programs like CapCut, Canva, and Figma. Additionally, I developed a social media presence linked to my YouTube channel. Currently, I have 63k followers on TikTok and 16k subscribers on YouTube. On TikTok, I have gathered a large number of views, accumulating approximately 800,000 views since September alone.</p>


                <p><strong>Feedpulse feedback received throughout the semester:</strong>

                    <p>Also I already wrote and showed screenshots, about me asking for feedback from my group members on Whats app, in the previous reviews. </p>
                    

                    <p><strong>Overall conclusion: </strong>This semester, I focused on expanding my programming skills through Codecademy courses and improving my design. I also developed in time managment and organisation, which was challenging due to my adhd. I gained new abilities with tools like Capcut, Canva, and Figma. I also built a strong social media presence, gaining 63k followers on TikTok and 16k subscribers on YouTube. Despite this progress, I faced challenges with consistently seeking feedback and presenting my work due to my anxiety and ADHD.

                        In addition to my overall growth, I took a personality test to better understand my strengths and weaknesses in group projects. I value independence, ambition, integrity, and creativity—qualities that help drive my personal and professional growth. Going forward, I plan to be more proactive in seeking feedback, presenting my work regularly, and engaging with my classmates to improve communication and collaboration. I’m committed to overcoming these challenges and pushing myself towards bigger goals in the next semester.</p>

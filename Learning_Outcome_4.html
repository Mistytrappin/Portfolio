            <p><strong>Presentation skills:</strong>

            <p>This semester, I delivered three presentations, including for the Blik project and a presentation for the Monk project. One of these was in front of Dirk, Lin, and my classmates, though initially intended for the client, Monk. However, the teachers were not informed that Monk would be absent. Despite this unexpected change, I was present and able to proceed. I received valuable feedback from my instructors. I’m particularly proud of my progress in handling presentations, as speaking in front of others challenges me significantly due to the nervousness and focus issues related to my ADHD as I am diagnosed with it.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Research:</strong>
                
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="Research outdoor (DOT FRAME).png" alt="form">
                </div>

                <p>Doing research with the DOT framework is important because it helps organize and structure the information clearly. It allows you to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts and evaluate them based on key factors.</p>

                <p>Couple weeks ago I also made a small research about most important frameworks that are being used in the front-end development industry :</p>

                <div class="images">
                    <img src="research about frame works.png" alt="form">
                    <img src="frameworks 2 research.png" alt="form">
                </div>
            
                <p><strong>Reflection:</strong>This is a breakdown of the different front-end tools like React, Angular, and Vue.js. I researched these using the DOT framework, focusing on the design, opportunities, and threats of each tool. It helps me understand how each one works and which one might be best for future projects</p>


                <p><strong>Chatgpt:</strong>Sometimes, I use this tool to find inspiration, but primarily to organize my ideas and improve my phrasing. Since I've been diagnosed with ADHD, I find this tool helpful for fixing my grammar mistakes and managing my flow of ideas, as well as for choosing better words to fully express what I mean. I also sometimes find it easier to describe something in Polish.

                    For example:
                    
                    *Original Prompt I used in ChatGPT*: **Przetłumacz i popraw błędy gramatyczne oraz składniowe:** Znalazłem tło złożone z wzoru fleur de lis na Adobe Stock. Użyłem go, ale zauważyłem, że nie pasuje i ma znak wodny. Postanowiłem zaprojektować własne tło na Canvie, aby było bardziej osobiste i zgodne z moją koncepcją. Uważam, że ważne jest, aby w tej branży wyróżniać się i być wyjątkowym specjalistą.
                    
                    *Translated Prompt*: Translate and correct grammatical and syntax errors: I found a background with a fleur de lis pattern on Adobe Stock. I used it but noticed it didn’t quite fit and that it had a watermark. I decided to design my own background on Canva to make it more personal and better aligned with my concept. I think it’s important in this industry to stand out and be a unique professional.</p>

            <h2>Forms</h2>
            <p>I created a contact form for my portfolio and noticed how recent trends in digital experience design influence this process. It's essential to apply modern design principles to ensure the form is user-friendly, efficient, and secure.
                While exploring digital experience design, I saw how online forms are changing with new trends. Their convenience and efficiency make them more popular than traditional paper forms. People prefer them because they are easy to use and allow for quick information processing, making them a key trend in data collection and user engagement.</p>
                
                <p><bold>Styling forms that I created :</bold></p>
                
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="form (1).jpg" alt="form">
                    <img src="After Form (1).jpg" alt="form"></div>
        
                <p> <strong>Reflection: </strong> For my portfolio, I used resources like YouTube and W3Schools, which helped me understand form creation and current design trends. This experience not only improved my skills for this project but also gave me insights I can use in the future. With this knowledge, I can create more advanced and user-friendly forms as I continue to develop my web skills. </p>

                    <h2>Using github</h2>
                    <p>Git hub is now essential in the tech industry for keeping your code under control. By using GitHub, I can easily share my work, get feedback, and keep track of my progress.

                        In today’s fast-paced development environment, knowing how to use GitHub is a valuable skill. It not only helps in maintaining organized code but also enhances teamwork and communication.  
                        That’s why I decided to learn how to use it. For this purpose I used Youtube tutorial:</p>

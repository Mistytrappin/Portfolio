        <h1>Development and Version Control</h1>
        <div class="section">

            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong>
            In terms of front-end development, I explored various coding languages and worked with version control tools, specifically Git and GitHub. After the first portfolio review, I started using Git to manage my project versions, ensuring that I could track changes and collaborate more effectively. GitHub became a crucial platform for me to share my code, get feedback, and keep my work organized. This hands-on approach helped me understand the importance of version control in maintaining a clean and efficient workflow, especially when working with multiple iterations of a project. </p>
            
            <p><strong>GitHub:</strong> I started to use GIT after the first portfolio review. I use it to have control over all of the versions of my code.</p>

            <p><strong>Notion:</strong>  is where I store all the evidence for my portfolio, keeping everything organized and easy to access.</p>

            <h2>Forms</h2>
            <p>I created a contact form for my portfolio and noticed how recent trends in digital experience design influence this process. It's essential to apply modern design principles to ensure the form is user-friendly, efficient, and secure.
                While exploring digital experience design, I saw how online forms are changing with new trends. Their convenience and efficiency make them more popular than traditional paper forms. People prefer them because they are easy to use and allow for quick information processing, making them a key trend in data collection and user engagement.</p>

                <p> <strong>Reflection: </strong> For my portfolio, I used resources like YouTube and W3Schools, which helped me understand form creation and current design trends. This experience not only improved my skills for this project but also gave me insights I can use in the future. With this knowledge, I can create more advanced and user-friendly forms as I continue to develop my web skills. </p>

                    <h2>Using github</h2>
                    <p>Git hub is now essential in the tech industry for keeping your code under control. By using GitHub, I can easily share my work, get feedback, and keep track of my progress.

                        In today’s fast-paced development environment, knowing how to use GitHub is a valuable skill. It not only helps in maintaining organized code but also enhances teamwork and communication.  
                        That’s why I decided to learn how to use it. For this purpose I used Youtube tutorial:</p>

            <h2>Blik project</h2>
            
            <p>In the BLIK project, I took on the role of a designer, focusing on creating prototypes and improving the overall look of the website. I also participated in presentations with stakeholders and prepared slides to showcase the design process, including fonts and prototypes I worked on.

                Throughout the project, I made sure to gather and apply feedback, testing different color schemes and layouts to create a user-friendly and visually appealing design. My goal was to ensure the website looked professional and met the needs of the project.</p>

            <h3> Prototypes: </h3>
            <p>I have created a wide range of prototypes for our BLIK project, consistently integrating the feedback provided throughout the design process. This involved experimenting with diverse color palettes and repeatedly refining the layout, testing various configurations to optimize the overall structure and flow of the webpage.</p>

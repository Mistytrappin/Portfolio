            <p><strong>Personal growth:</strong>I took a personality test during one of our lectures, to determine my typical role in group projects and to identify my strengths and weaknesses. 16Personalities Free personality test | 16Personalities</p>
            

        <p>Independence: I value the ability to make my own decisions and control my future. Whether it's in my personal life or career, being able to take charge of my path and not rely on others is really important to me. I believe independence helps me grow as an individual and also pushes me to be more self-reliant.

        Ambition: I’m driven to push myself and work towards bigger goals. I’m always thinking about how to improve, whether it's with my projects in the iniversity, my music, or my career. I want to be successful not just for the sake of it, but because I believe in challenging myself and becoming the best version of who I can be.
    
        Integrity: For me, it’s essential to always stay true to myself and be honest in everything I do. I believe integrity builds trust, and trust is something that I value deeply in all relationships, whether personal or professional. Staying aligned with my values, even when it’s difficult, is important for my sense of self.
    
        Creativity: is something I really value, especially in the work I do. Whether I’m working on a new music track or a personal project, being able to think outside the box and express myself freely is what drives me. It allows me to feel fulfilled and connected to what I’m passionate about.</p>


        <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> core values is an essential part of shaping both personal and professional growth. These values guide my decisions, help me stay focused on my goals, and keep me aligned with what truly matters to me in life.</p>

                <p><strong>Codeacademy:</strong></p>
                <p>I have completed several courses on Codecademy and continue to take new ones to develop my skills. Engaging in these courses is important because it allows me to learn practical programming techniques and stay updated with the latest trends in technology. Consistent learning helps me build confidence in my abilities and prepares me for real-world challenges in coding. By continuously improving, I can adapt to new tools and frameworks, which is essential for personal and professional growth in a rapidly evolving field.</p>

                <p><strong>Reflection:</strong>I created a project plan for my portfolio to make the process of building it more organized and efficient. By breaking down the tasks into smaller steps and assigning deadlines to each, I can stay on track and make sure everything gets done on time. This plan helps me focus on one thing at a time, from research and design to coding and adding content. It also allows me to incorporate feedback at the right moments and make adjustments as I go. With everything laid out in the plan, I can easily track my progress and avoid feeling overwhelmed, making the whole process smoother and more manageable.</p>

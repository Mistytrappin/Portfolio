            <h2>Websites / Applications </h2>
            <p><strong>Figma:</strong> Helped me design website layouts, create prototypes, and make mood boards, which improved my skills in planning and presenting visual ideas. (Website design, creating prototypes, moodboards.)</p>
            
            <p><strong>Youtube:</strong> Gave me access to lots of tutorials and courses, helping me learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript quickly through practical examples. (Courses, Tutorials, Learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript)</p>
            
            <p><strong>Codeacademy:</strong> The front-end course on Codecademy provided well-organized lessons, projects, and quizzes that helped me understand the basics of web development. (I bought a full front-end designer course / Learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript)</p>

            <p><strong>GitHub:</strong> I started to use GIT after the first portfolio review. I use it to have control over all of the versions of my code.</p>

            <p><strong>Chat Gpt:</strong>  helped me fix grammar and sentence structure mistakes, and I use it to learn how to add new features to my website.</p>

            <p><strong>Notion:</strong>  is where I store all the evidence for my portfolio, keeping everything organized and easy to access.</p>

            <h2>Forms</h2>
            <p>I created a contact form for my portfolio and noticed how recent trends in digital experience design influence this process. It's essential to apply modern design principles to ensure the form is user-friendly, efficient, and secure.
                While exploring digital experience design, I saw how online forms are changing with new trends. Their convenience and efficiency make them more popular than traditional paper forms. People prefer them because they are easy to use and allow for quick information processing, making them a key trend in data collection and user engagement.</p>
                <p> <strong>Reflection: </strong> For my portfolio, I used resources like YouTube and W3Schools, which helped me understand form creation and current design trends. This experience not only improved my skills for this project but also gave me insights I can use in the future. With this knowledge, I can create more advanced and user-friendly forms as I continue to develop my web skills. </p>

            <p><strong>Figma</strong> As a designer, I love seeing projects come together. In this group project, I created prototypes, presentation, and designed most of the website design! This portfolio highlights how communication and teamwork helped me achieve great results. I kept everyone informed throughout the process, from brainstorming ideas until the final presentation. By listening to each other, we built a nice environment where everyone's ideas were important and taken into consideration.</p>

            <p class="reflection">Reflection: Consistently leaving comments about the changes I made helped our team to keep transparency and good collaboration. I ensured that everyone was on the same page, reducing misunderstandings and improving our workflow.</p>

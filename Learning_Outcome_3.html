            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong>
                Throughout this semester, I utilized professional design tools and followed an iterative design process to enhance the visual quality of my work. For example, when designing the layout of my portfolio, I conducted research on design trends, including CSS Grid layouts, to ensure a modern, organized, and responsive presentation. I continuously adjusted my designs based on the knowledge I gained from tutorials, ensuring that the final product aligned with best practices in web design. This iterative approach allowed me to refine my work and create a user-friendly experience.</p>
            

                <p><strong>Paper prototypes:</strong>
                    Paper prototypes that I also designed and created from the “fast forward week” at the begining of the semester.</p>

                <p> I participated in the workshop where I learned how to create paper prototypes:</p>

                <p><strong>BLIK project:</strong>    
                    I have created a wide range of prototypes for our BLIK project, consistently integrating the feedback provided throughout the design process. This involved experimenting with diverse color palettes and repeatedly refining the layout, testing various configurations to optimize the overall structure and flow of the webpage.</p>
                
                    <div class="images">

                    <p> First prototype Low fidelity for Blik.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p> This is the first version of the blik website that I created.</p>
                    <p><strong style="color: red;">Feedback: </strong>  I received feedback that the website blends together because  of the colours I used.</p>
                    
                    <div class="images">

                    </div>
                    <p> This is the second version of the blik website that I created.</p>
                    <p><strong style="color: red;">Action: </strong> I changed the colour to red to make the website standout more.</p>
                    <p><strong style="color: red;">Feedback: </strong> I received a feedback that the website looks more like an appliaction.</p>

                    <p> I participated in the workshop where I learned how to create paper prototypes:</p>
                    
                    <div class="images">
                        <img src="before the newest version (blik) (1).png" alt="prototype">

                    </div>
                    <p> Here is the third version of the website that I created.</p>
                    <p><strong style="color: red;">Action: </strong> I tried many different layouts of the website, creating stripes and using different colours.</p>
                    <p><strong style="color: red;">Feedback: </strong> I was told that the website need more consistenct and more website-like elements in the design. Like footer, sidebar etc.</p>

                    <div class="images">
                        <img src="final prototype (blik) by me (1).png" alt="prototype">
                    </div>
                    <p> This is the fourth and final version of the design that I made for blik.</p>
                    <p><strong style="color: red;">Action: </strong>Finally, I tidied up the design to present it neatly.</p>
                    <div class="images">

                    <p> Final Version of the blik website prototype</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><strong>Personal Portfolio:</strong>  
                
                        <div class="images">
                            <img src="portfoliopro1.png" alt="prototype">
                        </div>
                        <p> This is the first sketch (low fidelity prototype) that I made for my portfolio.</p>
                        <div class="images">
                            <img src="portfoliofeed1.png" alt="prototype">
                        </div>
                        <p>In this version, I began developing a general concept for how my website would look. I added a drop-down menu, but later received feedback that it appeared outdated and unnecessarily complicated the website's navigation.</p>
                        <div>
                        <img src="feedpro.png" alt="prototype">

                        </div>
                        <p>In this version, I have applied the feedback received on the previous iteration. I removed the unnecessary drop-down menu and redesigned the layout to achieve a more modern look, ensuring the text on the website is more visible. Additionally, I added links to my social media profiles. The feedback on this version focused on making a few adjustments: replacing the current social media links with icons, resizing the oversized image by adding a blur effect, and ensuring it is symmetrically placed. I was also told that the photo doesn’t look professional because of the people in the background, and I was advised to work within frames to maintain the correct resolution in my prototype. I also received feedback from Dirk, who mentioned that my website looked more like an application, so I need to adjust it to look like an actual website.</p>

                            <p>I applied the feedback that I received in the previous iteration. I’ve added blur effect and removed the background from the photo.</p>

                                            <p>During this feedback session, the teacher recommended that the design should be more cohesive and that I should add more evidence into Learning Outcomes 4 and 5. Additionally, I should add more information into the "about me" section. Overall, she mentioned that the design is good but requires a few improvements. Next, I will implement this feedback into my portfolio.</p>

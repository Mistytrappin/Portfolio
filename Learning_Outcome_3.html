            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong>
                Throughout this semester, I utilized professional design tools and followed an iterative design process to enhance the visual quality of my work. For example, when designing the layout of my portfolio, I conducted research on design trends, including CSS Grid layouts, to ensure a modern, organized, and responsive presentation. I continuously adjusted my designs based on the knowledge I gained from tutorials, ensuring that the final product aligned with best practices in web design. This iterative approach allowed me to refine my work and create a user-friendly experience.</p>
            

                <p><strong>Paper prototypes:</strong>
                    Paper prototypes that I also designed and created from the “fast forward week” at the begining of the semester.</p>

                <p><strong>BLIK project:</strong>    
                    I have created a wide range of prototypes for our BLIK project, consistently integrating the feedback provided throughout the design process. This involved experimenting with diverse color palettes and repeatedly refining the layout, testing various configurations to optimize the overall structure and flow of the webpage.</p>

                    <p><strong style="color: red;">Action: </strong> I tried many different layouts of the website, creating stripes and using different colours.</p>
                    <p><strong style="color: red;">Feedback: </strong> I was told that the website need more consistenct and more website-like elements in the design. Like footer, sidebar etc.</p>

                        <p>In this version, I began developing a general concept for how my website would look. I added a drop-down menu, but later received feedback that it appeared outdated and unnecessarily complicated the website's navigation.</p>

                        <p>In this version, I have applied the feedback received on the previous iteration. I removed the unnecessary drop-down menu and redesigned the layout to achieve a more modern look, ensuring the text on the website is more visible. Additionally, I added links to my social media profiles. The feedback on this version focused on making a few adjustments: replacing the current social media links with icons, resizing the oversized image by adding a blur effect, and ensuring it is symmetrically placed. I was also told that the photo doesn’t look professional because of the people in the background, and I was advised to work within frames to maintain the correct resolution in my prototype. I also received feedback from Dirk, who mentioned that my website looked more like an application, so I need to adjust it to look like an actual website.</p>

Additionally, I should add more information into the "about me" section. Overall, she mentioned that the design is good but requires a few improvements. Next, I will implement this feedback into my portfolio.</p>

                                                    <p>At the start of designing the background for my portfolio, I began by looking for inspiration. I realized that this portfolio should connect with who I am and reflect my personality, so I thought about combining my interest in history and royal dynasties with a modern, clean design. I’ve always admired the "fleur-de-lis" symbol, a classic emblem used frequently in medieval heraldry. I came across a background on Adobe Stock featuring a fleur-de-lis pattern, which I tried using, but I noticed it didn’t quite fit my vision and had a watermark. So, I decided to design my own background on Canva, to make it feel more personal and fitting with my concept. I believe it’s essential in this industry to stand out and bring a unique touch as a specialist.</p>

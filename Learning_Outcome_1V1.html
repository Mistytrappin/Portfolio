            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong>
            In order to create a professional portfolio, I researched and familiarized myself with the latest trends in web development, design, and media tools. For the tech stack, I explored the following: </p>
            
            <h2>Websites / Applications </h2>
            
            <p><strong>Web Design Trends:</strong> I paid attention to minimalism and usability in web design. I researched various portfolio examples and noticed that clean, grid-based layouts were gaining popularity due to their simplicity and ease of navigation.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Tools & Platforms:</strong>  I used tools like Figma for prototyping, GitHub for version control, and VSCode for writing and testing my code. I ensured that my portfolio was built to be responsive and visually appealing across all devices.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Emerging Web Technologies:</strong> I explored CSS Grid, Flexbox, and JavaScript frameworks like React to enhance the interactive features of my site, ensuring a smooth user experience.</p>

            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong>By keeping up with these technologies and trends, I made sure that my final product was in line with modern expectations.</strong></p>


            <p><strong>GitHub:</strong> I started to use GIT after the first portfolio review. I use it to have control over all of the versions of my code.</p>

            <p><strong>Chat Gpt:</strong>  helped me fix grammar and sentence structure mistakes, and I use it to learn how to add new features to my website.</p> </div>
